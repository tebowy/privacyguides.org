iOS is the operating system that runs on iPhones. iOS is a good choice if you want privacy and security without much effort.

## Configuration

You should consider changing these settings to improve your privacy.

### Wi-Fi

You can enable hardware address randomization to protect you from tracking across Wi-Fi networks.

On the network you are currently connected to, press the :material-information: button.

AirDrop allows you to easily transfer files, but it can allow strangers to send you files you do not want.

AirPlay lets you seemlessly stream content from your iPhone to a TV; however, you might not always want this.

Background App Refresh allows your apps to refresh their content while you're not using them. This may cause them to make unwanted connections.

### Siri & Search

If you want to make use of Apple's digital assistant, be sure to make it only activate after the Device is unlocked to prevent unauthorized access via Utlrasonic Hacking techniques.

As of iOS 15, iOS uses Machine Learning & On-Device Proccessing to deliver things and your Vocie data never leaves your device. Unless you opt-in for Analytics or Speech Improvement services.
