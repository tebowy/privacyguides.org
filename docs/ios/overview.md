iOS is the operating system that runs on iPhones. iOS is a good choice if you want privacy and security without much effort.

## App Privacy Report

App Privacy Report is a built-in tool that allows you to see what permissions your apps are using.

You should consider changing these settings to improve your privacy.

AirPlay lets you seemlessly stream content from your iPhone to a TV; however, you might not always want this.

### Siri & Search

If you want to make use of Apple's digital assistant, be sure to make it only activate after the Device is unlocked to prevent unauthorized access via Utlrasonic Hacking techniques.

As of iOS 15, iOS uses Machine Learning & On-Device Proccessing to deliver things and your Vocie data never leaves your device. Unless you opt-in for Analytics or Speech Improvement services.

## Avoid Jailbreaking

Jailbreaking an iPhone defeats its security and makes you vulnerable.
